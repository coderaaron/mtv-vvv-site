Multitenant VVV site
mtvvv is a site configuration for use with [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/).  It's based off the talk I gave at WordCamp St. Louis which in turn was based on a talk a WPCampus by [Cliff Seal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88cMYrr4-5o).
# Instructions
Follow the instructions in the [VVV documentation](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) and set the 'repo:' argument to `https://github.com/coderaaron/mtv-vvv-site.git`
